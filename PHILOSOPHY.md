# Why I built Recall OS

This is the honest version of _why_ this tool exists. The README tells you what it does. This tells
you the problem I kept hitting and the small, workable thing I built to deal with it.

## The problem I see non technical founder kept running into

AI makes it fast to get software to a working shape. The gap shows up later: most of the _why_ — the
decisions, the constraints, the rules — lives in the chat, not in the repo. The code ships, but the
reasoning behind it doesn't come with it.

That's fine until the product reaches a shape and other people take over — a teammate, a real
engineering team, or just a fresh agent next week. They inherit the code without the context, and
have to reverse-engineer or re-decide things that were already settled. I wanted what I (or anyone,
even someone vibe-coding their way to a first version) build with AI to be able to **scale past
me**: to hand off cleanly and keep its reasoning intact.

## What I wanted instead

I didn't want a smarter model or a hosted "memory" service. I wanted something boring and
dependable: the project's decisions and rules written into **plain files that live in the repo**,
get reviewed in pull requests, and are still there next session — so I don't have to think about
context, summarizing, or re-explaining at all.

> Git tracks what changed. I wanted something that tracks why it changed.

That's all Recall OS really is: a quick, workable way to keep durable engineering memory next to
your code, and a discipline system that nudges the work to actually get written down.

## The bet: discipline, not magic

Recall OS doesn't call an AI model, hit the network, or send telemetry. Not because that's purer —
because I wanted the part that _checks_ my work to be trustworthy and free.

`recall doctor` is deliberately simple and deterministic. It doesn't judge whether your architecture
is good — it can't, and I don't want it pretending it can. It checks the boring, reliable things:
are the docs that should exist there, is a "done" claim backed by test evidence, does the memory
point at an ADR or a source file that doesn't exist anymore. Same input, same answer, every time.
I'd rather have a dumb check I can trust than a clever one I can't.

The actual thinking still comes from the agent (Claude, Codex, Cursor). Recall OS's job isn't to be
smart — it's to put the right memory in front of the agent and make the agent's work persist. So it
wires each tool with its own native mechanism: a SessionStart hook that injects a live memory map in
Claude Code, an always-apply rule for Cursor, and `AGENTS.md` (which both Codex and Cursor
auto-load) as the portable floor. The dynamic per-session map is a Claude Code bonus, not a promise
everywhere — I'd rather be honest about that than pretend one trick works in every tool. I can't
force a model to be correct, but I _can_ stop re-explaining the project every single time.

## It proposes, you decide

It's architecture-neutral on purpose. It records _your_ decisions; it never makes them for you.
Presets, `recall adopt`, and MCP capture all produce **proposed** memory that a human accepts with
`recall adr accept`. Nothing becomes "truth" silently — a proposal you can review beats a guess the
tool slipped in.

## What it's honestly not

- Not an AI agent or an app generator. It writes memory, not your product code — and that's the
  point: it's the durable layer the agent has been missing.
- Not magic recall. It's something better for a codebase: external memory you can read, review, and
  trust, because it lives in the repo instead of a model's context.
- It won't _rubber-stamp_ your architecture as good — that judgment stays with you and the agent,
  which is exactly where it belongs. But it does help you get there: presets propose vetted,
  stack-specific defaults (Laravel, Next.js, FastAPI, and more) that you accept or reject, never
  silently. And it guarantees the reasoning is **captured, consistent, and backed by evidence** —
  the part teams almost always lose, and the part everything else builds on.

## The short version

This is a personal tool that grew up. It improves how I build software indirectly — through
discipline, not magic: decide acceptance before coding, write decisions down, keep evidence for
"done," and stop losing the reasoning to a summarized chat. If you've felt the same friction, maybe
it helps you too.
