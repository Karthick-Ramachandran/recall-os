## Status

Proposed. Everything below is inferred from this repository and requires human review. Nothing here
is accepted repository memory until you accept it.

## Detected Signals

- Languages: ${formatList(signals.languages)}
- Package manager: ${signals.packageManager ?? "none detected"}
- Frameworks: ${formatList(signals.frameworks)}
- Tests present: ${formatBool(signals.hasTests)}
- README present: ${formatBool(signals.hasReadme)}
- Docs folder present: ${formatBool(signals.hasDocs)}

## Proposed Decisions

${renderProposedDecisions(adrDir, signals)}

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Confirm the detected languages and package manager.
- [ ] Accept or reject each proposed framework ADR under \`${adrDir}/proposed/\`.
- [ ] Run \`recall init\` to establish neutral repository memory if it does not exist yet.
- [ ] Record any decision you accept with \`recall adr create\` or by accepting the proposed ADR.

## Notes

This report was produced by \`recall adopt\` through read-only inspection of manifest and marker
files. No repository code was executed and no decision was accepted automatically.

## Status

Proposed

## Context

\`recall adopt\` detected ${framework} in this repository through read-only inspection.

## Decision

Consider recording ${framework} as an accepted architecture decision. This is proposed by adoption
and is not accepted until a human reviews and accepts it.

## Alternatives Considered

- Record a different framework.
- Leave the decision unrecorded for now.

## Consequences

- Captures a framework already in use as reviewable repository memory.
- Requires explicit human acceptance before it becomes repository truth.
