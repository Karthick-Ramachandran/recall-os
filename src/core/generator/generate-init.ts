# {{repositoryName}} repository memory

This repository uses Recall OS. Durable memory lives in \`docs/\` and is the source of truth over chat
history. Do not treat chat history as truth, and repository rules override model preference.

Before non-trivial work:

- Read \`AGENTS.md\` and the docs it routes to.
- Accepted decisions live in \`docs/adrs/\`; module memory lives in \`docs/30-modules/\`.
- If an instruction conflicts with accepted repository memory, stop and report the conflict.

Source-of-truth order: accepted ADRs and repository decisions, then architecture docs, engineering
standards, the current PRD, security and testing docs, module docs, feature plans, then chat history.

Before claiming work is complete, run \`recall doctor\` and fix reported errors.

## Status

Draft — fill the prompted sections below with this repository's real model as it grows. \`recall doctor\`
flags these as warnings once the repository has real work (a feature, module, or accepted decision).

## Baseline Rules

- Never commit secrets or credentials, and never read or copy \`.env\` files into docs.
- Validate and authorize untrusted input at every trust boundary.
- Do not add network, telemetry, cloud, MCP runtime, or AI API behavior without explicit review.

## Authentication And Authorization

Describe how this repository authenticates users or clients and how it authorizes actions, including
where those checks live.

## Secrets And Configuration

Describe where secrets live, how they are injected, and how configuration is kept out of version
control.

## Sensitive Data

Describe the sensitive or personal data this repository handles, and how it is protected at rest and
in transit.

## Dependencies And Supply Chain

Describe how third-party dependencies are vetted, pinned, and updated.

## Status

Draft — replace the prompts below with this repository's real analysis as it grows. \`recall doctor\`
flags these as warnings once the repository has real work (a feature, module, or accepted decision).

## Assets

Describe what this repository must protect: user data, credentials, money, availability, or
reputation.

## Entry Points

Describe where untrusted input enters: HTTP endpoints, webhooks, file uploads, queues, CLI input, or
third-party callbacks.

## Trust Boundaries

Describe where trust changes: client to server, service to database, your code to third-party APIs.

## Threats

Describe the concrete threats that apply to this repository, by category:

- Spoofing — how identities are faked or sessions stolen.
- Tampering — how requests, data, or builds are altered (injection, mass assignment).
- Repudiation — actions that must remain auditable.
- Information disclosure — how sensitive data or secrets could leak.
- Denial of service — how the system can be overwhelmed or abused.
- Elevation of privilege — how a user could gain access they should not have.

## Mitigations

Describe the control in place or planned for each threat above.

## Open Risks

Describe accepted or unresolved risks and who owns them.

## Completion Gate

Before claiming implementation work is complete, run:

pnpm typecheck
recall doctor

If \`recall doctor\` reports errors, fix them or report why they cannot be fixed. If it reports
warnings, address them or record why they are acceptable.

Package binary behavior is covered by binary integration tests.

## Commands

### \`recall init\`

Initialize neutral repository memory.

Options:

- \`--preset <id>\`: apply optional preset guidance and proposed decisions.
- \`--dry-run\`: show planned writes without writing files.
- \`--force\`: overwrite existing files explicitly.
- \`--reinit\`: required with \`--force\` to overwrite an existing Recall OS installation
  (a directory that already has \`.recall/config.json\`). Without it, \`--force\` refuses, protecting
  existing repository memory.

Init also generates a tracked pre-commit hook at \`.recall/hooks/pre-commit\` that runs \`recall doctor\`
plus any \`preCommitGates\` in \`.recall/config.json\`. Init proposes, but does not run, the activation
command \`git config core.hooksPath .recall/hooks\`.

### \`recall adopt\`

Inspect an existing repository through read-only manifest and marker files, then write a proposed
adoption report and proposed framework ADRs for human review. Adopt never executes repository code
and never produces accepted memory.

Options:

- \`--dry-run\`: show planned writes without writing files.
- \`--force\`: overwrite existing files explicitly.

### \`recall skill create <name>\`

Generate a portable AI agent skill as \`SKILL.md\` for both Claude Code (\`.claude/skills/\`) and the
portable Agent Skills target (\`.agents/skills/\`). Known names use the built-in catalog; unknown names
produce a valid skeleton. Generated skills contain no scripts.

Options:

- \`--dry-run\`: show planned writes without writing files.
- \`--force\`: overwrite existing files explicitly.

### \`recall skill list\`

List the built-in catalog skills.

### \`recall mcp add <server>\`

Generate offline, proposed memory for an MCP server (for example \`figma\`) as \`docs/ai/mcp/<server>.md\`
plus a proposed adoption ADR. Recall OS never connects to the MCP server or makes network calls; the
agent records durable MCP-derived context into the generated memory for human review. It also
installs a \`capture-mcp-context\` agent skill that prompts the agent to record that context.

Options:

- \`--dry-run\`: show planned writes without writing files.
- \`--force\`: overwrite existing files explicitly.

### \`recall preset list\`

List built-in presets.

### \`recall feature create <name>\`

Create feature memory docs under the configured features directory.

Options:

- \`--dry-run\`: show planned writes without writing files.
- \`--force\`: overwrite existing files explicitly.

### \`recall adr create <title>\`

Create a proposed ADR under the configured ADR directory.

Options:

- \`--dry-run\`: show planned writes without writing files.
- \`--force\`: overwrite existing files explicitly.

### \`recall adr accept <name>\`

Promote a proposed ADR to accepted repository memory. A proposal under
\`docs/adrs/proposed/ADR-PROPOSED-<slug>.md\` becomes a numbered, accepted \`ADR-####-<slug>.md\` and the
proposal is removed; an existing numbered Proposed ADR is accepted in place.

Options:

- \`--dry-run\`: show planned writes without writing files.
- \`--force\`: overwrite existing files explicitly.

### \`recall module create <name>\`

Create module memory docs under the configured modules directory.

Options:

- \`--dry-run\`: show planned writes without writing files.
- \`--force\`: overwrite existing files explicitly.

### \`recall doctor\`

Check whether repository memory is structurally healthy enough for AI-assisted work, whether basic
engineering evidence is present, and whether memory references decisions that exist and are accepted.

Doctor also runs deterministic drift checks: feature or module memory that references a missing ADR
is an error, and memory that references a not-yet-accepted ADR is a warning.

Exit codes:

- \`0\`: healthy
- \`1\`: warnings only
- \`2\`: errors
