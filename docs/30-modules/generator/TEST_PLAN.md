# Generator Test Plan

## P3 Tests

- Placeholder rendering is deterministic.
- Missing values fail clearly.
- Invalid placeholder names fail clearly.
- Invalid context keys fail before rendering.
- Prototype-adjacent keys are rejected.
- Logic and execution syntax are rejected.
- Code-like strings render as text.

## Future Tests

- Done: Golden tests for init-generated documents.
- Done: Integration tests for init command generation.
- Done: Unit tests for generated feature document paths and starter content.
- Security tests for unsafe output destinations after generator plans are connected to filesystem writes.

## Security Expectations

- The renderer must not execute template content.
- The renderer must not load template files.
- The renderer must not write files.
- Future file generation must use `core/filesystem`.

## P6 Tests

- `generateFeatureFiles` emits all required feature docs.
- `generateFeatureFiles` returns write inputs only.
- Unsafe feature names are rejected before write planning.

## P6 Results

- Covered by `tests/unit/generator/generate-feature.test.ts`.
- Full verification passed with `pnpm test:run` and `pnpm typecheck`.

## P7 Tests

- `generateAdrFile` emits required ADR sections.
- `generateAdrFile` returns write inputs only.
- `generateAdrFile` sets status to `Proposed`.
- Unsafe ADR titles are rejected before write planning.

## P7 Results

- Covered by `tests/unit/generator/generate-adr.test.ts`.
- Full verification passed with `pnpm test:run` and `pnpm typecheck`.
