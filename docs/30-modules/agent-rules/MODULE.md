# Module: Agent Rules

## Purpose

Agent rules define how AI tools should behave when working in the repository.

## Owns

- Repository rules override model preferences.
- AI stop conditions.
- Required reading for agents.
- Completion evidence behavior.
- Doctor completion gate guidance.

## Does Not Own

- Tool-specific runtime integrations.
- MCP server behavior.
- AI model selection.
- Runtime enforcement.

## Current Decision

Agents must follow repository memory over model preference and stop when instructions conflict.

P9 adds Doctor as the repository memory health check agents should run before claiming completion
when the CLI binary is available.
