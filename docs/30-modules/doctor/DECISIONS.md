# Doctor Decisions

## P9: Doctor Is Read-Only

P9 Doctor validates repository memory health and reports findings.

It does not fix or mutate files.

## P9: Exit Code Severity

Doctor uses:

```txt
0 = healthy
1 = warnings only
2 = errors
```

This makes Doctor useful as an AI completion gate.

## P9: Structural Checks First

P9 validates deterministic memory structure and required sections.

Semantic drift detection remains future work.

## P10: Persist Paths

Doctor treats `.persist/config.json` and `docs/ai/PERSIST_COMMANDS.md` as required repository
memory.

## P12: Standards Evidence Checks

Doctor now checks deterministic engineering evidence in repository memory.

Completed features require review, test evidence, and result evidence. ADRs require consequence
substance. Security-sensitive feature planning requires security impact notes.

These checks are read-only and deterministic. Semantic drift detection remains future work.

## P13: Deterministic Drift Checks

Doctor now performs the first deterministic drift checks against accepted repository memory.

Feature and module memory that references an `ADR-####` identifier with no matching ADR file is an
error. Memory that references an existing ADR whose status is not accepted is a warning. References
to existing accepted ADRs produce no finding.

These checks remain read-only, local, and deterministic. They reuse the existing `DoctorFinding`
model and exit-code mapping. Semantic contradiction detection, module-ownership comparison, and
code-to-doc drift remain future work.
