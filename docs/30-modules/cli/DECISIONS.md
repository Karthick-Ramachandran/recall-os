# CLI Decisions

## P5: Parser Now, Bin Later

P5 adds Commander parser wiring and a testable `main(argv, io)` entrypoint.

Package `bin`, build, and release wiring are deferred to P10 so the project does not expose a broken
installed binary.

## P5: Output Is Evidence

CLI output should list created, skipped, overwritten, or planned files.

Completion claims must be backed by write results.

## P6: Commands Orchestrate Only

`feature create` command code loads config, calls naming, generator, and filesystem modules, then
formats output.

The CLI layer does not own feature numbering, document content, or write safety rules.

## P7: ADR Create Follows Command Boundary

`adr create` command code loads config, calls naming, generator, and filesystem modules, then
formats output.

The CLI layer does not own ADR numbering, document content, or write safety rules.

## P8: Shared Write Summary Helper

Command output uses a shared write-summary helper for created, overwritten, skipped, and planned
file lists.

Config loading and command error handling remain command-specific in P8.

## P8: Module Create Follows Command Boundary

`module create` command code loads config, calls naming, generator, and filesystem modules, then
formats output.

The CLI layer does not own module document content or write safety rules.

## P9: Doctor Is A Completion Gate

The `doctor` command reports repository memory health for humans and AI agents.

The CLI layer dispatches Doctor and returns its exit code, but `core/doctor` owns the health checks
and report content.

## P10: Packaged Binary

P10 exposes the CLI through the `recall` binary.

The binary delegates to the same `main(argv, io)` entrypoint used by integration tests.

## P10: Preset List Is Read-Only

`preset list` reads from the built-in preset registry and formats deterministic output.

It does not apply presets, generate files, or write repository memory.
