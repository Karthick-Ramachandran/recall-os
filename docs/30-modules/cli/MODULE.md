# Module: CLI

## Purpose

The CLI module owns command parser wiring, user-facing output, and process-level command results.

## Owns

- Commander parser setup.
- `main(argv, io)` test entrypoint.
- Command dispatch.
- Calm user-facing output.
- Exit-code style command results.
- Shared write-summary formatting.
- Packaged `recall` binary dispatch.

## Does Not Own

- File write rules.
- Config schema.
- Template rendering.
- Preset validation.
- Init document generation rules.
- Feature numbering or generation rules.
- ADR numbering or generation rules.
- Module generation rules.
- Doctor health check rules.
- Package contents or release workflow ownership.
- Network, telemetry, MCP runtime, AI API, or cloud behavior.

## Public Interfaces

- `main`
- `createCliProgram`
- `CliIo`

## Current Decision

P5 adds parser wiring without package `bin` or build/release setup.

P6 routes `feature create <name>` to command orchestration while keeping business rules in core
modules.

P7 routes `adr create <title>` to command orchestration while keeping business rules in core
modules.

P8 routes `module create <name>` to command orchestration while keeping business rules in core
modules.

P9 routes `doctor` to Doctor orchestration while keeping repository memory checks in `core/doctor`.

P10 exposes the same command surface through the packaged `recall` binary and adds read-only
`preset list` command dispatch.
