# Tech Stack

## MVP Stack

- Language: TypeScript
- Runtime: Node.js LTS
- Package manager: pnpm
- CLI framework: Commander
- Validation: Zod
- Template engine: internal deterministic placeholder renderer
- Tests: Vitest
- Build: tsup
- Linting: ESLint
- Formatting: Prettier
- CI: GitHub Actions
- Distribution: npm

## Rationale

This stack supports `npx recall init`, strong typing, deterministic builds, fast tests, and a familiar OSS contributor experience.

## Constraints

- Keep runtime dependencies small and defensible.
- Do not add production dependencies without ADR consideration.
- Prefer standard library APIs for filesystem work unless a dependency clearly reduces risk.
- Do not add dependencies that introduce network behavior in MVP runtime.
- Do not add postinstall scripts or hidden background behavior.

## Future Review

Any change to language, runtime, package manager, template engine, validation library, build system, or distribution model requires an ADR.

The P3 template renderer decision is recorded in `docs/adrs/ADR-0001-deterministic-placeholder-renderer.md`. Advanced template engines such as Eta are deferred until a future ADR.
