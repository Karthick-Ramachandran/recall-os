# BRD: Recall OS

## 1. Business Requirements Document

## 1.1 Product Name

Working name: **Recall OS**

Alternative names under consideration:

* RepoMemory
* DriftKit
* ArchKit
* SpecRail
* ContextForge

The final name should be short, memorable, OSS-friendly, easy to search, and not already occupied by an existing AI infrastructure product.

---

## 1.2 Executive Summary

Recall OS is an open-source CLI that creates and maintains an AI-ready engineering memory layer inside software repositories.

It helps developers, founders, and AI-assisted builders create better software by giving AI coding agents durable project context, architectural boundaries, test expectations, security expectations, review workflows, and documentation discipline.

Recall OS is an Engineering Memory Operating System.

It preserves product intent, architecture decisions, module ownership, testing requirements, security assumptions, engineering standards, and operational discipline, and makes them durable, reviewable, and AI-readable.

Recall OS is intentionally architecture-neutral. Its role is not to determine what architecture a team should adopt. Its role is to ensure that architecture decisions, regardless of their content, become durable, reviewable, AI-readable repository memory.

Recall OS is not a boilerplate generator. It is not an AI coding agent. It is not a SaaS product.

It is a local-first repository operating system for AI-assisted software delivery.

Git initializes source control.

Recall OS initializes repository memory.

Code may come before or after Recall OS.

The central belief:

> AI can produce code quickly, but without durable engineering memory, architecture decisions, module boundaries, testing discipline, and review gates, AI-assisted projects drift into messy, fragile software.

Recall OS exists to prevent that.

---

## 1.3 Vision

Recall OS should become the default open-source foundation layer for AI-assisted software development.

The long-term vision is that a developer can run:

```bash
npx recall init
```

and the repository becomes ready for serious AI-assisted development.

It should create the structure that helps Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and future AI coding agents work inside a repo safely.

The default `recall init` experience should be neutral: memory engine first, no technology opinions, no architecture opinions.

`recall init` should work in an empty folder. It should not require an existing application, framework, or Git repository, though Git is recommended for normal development.

The desired category:

> Engineering Memory Operating System

Not:

> Markdown generator

Not:

> Boilerplate generator

Not:

> Prompt pack

The public reputation goal is for developers to remember:

> “Use Recall OS first before letting AI build your repo.”

## 1.4 Problem Statement

AI coding tools are improving fast, but many repositories are not prepared for AI-driven work.

Common problems:

* Architecture decisions live only in chat history.
* AI agents forget context after compaction or session changes.
* Requirements change without PRDs being updated.
* AI introduces inconsistent patterns across features.
* Modules do not have clear ownership.
* Tests are created randomly instead of being derived from requirements and risks.
* Security docs are generic and useless.
* Review focuses only on whether code works, not whether architecture is preserved.
* Different AI tools need different instruction files.
* AI agents create “done” messages without evidence.
* Teams lack a repeatable process for handling architecture drift.
* Existing tools focus on code generation, task generation, or token reduction, but not durable engineering memory.

This causes fast technical debt.

AI increases code volume faster than it increases architectural judgment.

Recall OS solves this by creating a structured, version-controlled engineering memory system.

---

## 1.7 Core Value Proposition

Recall OS gives AI agents durable rails.

It creates a version-controlled repository memory system with five layers:

```txt
1. Product memory
   PRDs, roadmap, user stories, acceptance criteria

2. Architecture memory
   architecture docs, ADRs, module boundaries, dependency policy

3. Module memory
   MODULE.md per module, module test plans, module decisions

4. Execution memory
   feature plans, tasks, change requests, review reports

5. Verification memory
   tests, checklists, security reviews, completion reports, CI evidence
```

The main promise:

> Stop relying on perfect prompts. Give the repo durable memory.

Recall OS does not make architecture decisions.

Recall OS records, distributes, validates, and protects architecture decisions.

Those decisions can come from repository owners, accepted ADRs, organization standards, or optional presets.

---

## 1.8 Strategic Differentiation

Recall OS is different from adjacent tools.

### Not a boilerplate generator

Boilerplate generators create source code structure.

Recall OS creates engineering memory and AI workflow structure.

### Not a repo summarizer

Repo summarizers compress existing context.

Recall OS creates and maintains the source-of-truth context.

### Not a task manager

Task tools create task lists.

Recall OS links tasks back to PRDs, ADRs, module docs, test plans, and change requests.

### Not an AI coding agent

Recall OS does not write production app code.

It prepares the repository so AI coding agents can work better.

### Not a prompt pack

Prompt packs are temporary.

Recall OS writes durable, version-controlled artifacts.

---

## 1.12 Business Risks

### Risk 1: Perceived as “just markdown generation”

Mitigation:

* Strong README positioning
* Demo real workflow
* Include `doctor`
* Include feature, ADR, module, and review workflows
* Show before/after AI workflow

### Risk 2: Too much process for solo builders

Mitigation:

* Add modes: lite, standard, strict
* Keep MVP default practical
* Use guided mode later
* Generated docs should be short and useful

### Risk 3: Too many stacks too early

Mitigation:

* Make neutral init the primary path
* Treat presets as optional opinion packs
* Design preset system for community extension
* Do not personally maintain every framework
* Treat technology detection as guidance, not accepted repository memory

### Risk 4: Generated docs become fluff

Mitigation:

* Add document quality rubric
* Keep templates specific
* Require source-of-truth links
* Include professional testing/security standards

### Risk 5: Unsafe file writes damage user repos

Mitigation:

* Safe path validation
* Skip existing files by default
* `--dry-run`
* `--force` only explicit
* Security tests
* Symlink protection

### Risk 6: OSS community quality drops

Mitigation:

* CONTRIBUTING.md
* GOVERNANCE.md
* PRESET_CONTRIBUTION_GUIDE.md
* RFC process
* Preset schema
* Golden tests for presets

---

## 1.13 Governance Requirements

Recall OS should include:

```txt
GOVERNANCE.md
CONTRIBUTING.md
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
SECURITY.md
PRESET_CONTRIBUTION_GUIDE.md
RFC_TEMPLATE.md
```

Major changes should require RFCs:

* Plugin system
* Remote preset registry
* Telemetry
* AI-powered generation
* Cloud features
* Security-sensitive behavior
* Remote templates

ADR vs RFC distinction:

```txt
RFC = proposed change before decision
ADR = accepted architecture decision after decision
```

---

## 1.14 Open Source License

Recommended:

```txt
Code: MIT
Generated output/templates: MIT / no attribution required
```

Reason:

* Developers should be able to use generated files in commercial and open-source projects.
* No attribution burden.
* Maximum adoption.
* OSS-friendly.

---

## 1.15 Trust and Privacy Requirements

Recall OS must be local-first.

Security promises:

* No telemetry in MVP
* No network calls in MVP
* No API keys
* No repo upload
* No source-code analysis beyond basic project detection
* No reading `.env` files
* No secret collection
* No hidden background process
* No dependency installation inside user projects

This should be clearly stated in README.

---

## 1.16 Product Positioning

One-liner:

> Recall OS creates AI-ready engineering memory for your repository.

Short pitch:

> AI coding agents move fast. Recall OS gives them specs, ADRs, module memory, security expectations, test strategy, review gates, and architecture drift checks so they can build without wrecking your codebase.

Category:

> AI-ready engineering memory

Taglines:

* “Prompting is temporary. Repo memory is durable.”
* “Give AI agents decisions, not vibes.”
* “Specs, ADRs, tests, and drift checks for AI-built software.”
* “The missing memory layer for AI coding agents.”

---

## 1.17 Launch Strategy

### Launch Assets

* Strong README
* Demo GIF or terminal recording
* Generated examples
* Blog post: “Why AI-built repos need engineering memory”
* Sample generated Next.js repo
* Sample generated iOS Swift repo
* Sample generated Flutter repo
* Comparison with raw prompting
* Public roadmap

### Initial Launch Channels

* GitHub
* LinkedIn
* X
* Hacker News
* Reddit developer communities
* AI coding communities
* Indie hacker communities

### Launch Message

Focus less on “CLI that creates files.”

Focus more on:

> AI can write code. Recall OS helps it build software.

---

## 1.18 Final BRD Recommendation

Build Recall OS as an OSS foundation layer for AI-assisted software delivery.

The project should be useful to:

* Experienced engineers who want discipline
* Solo founders who want structure
* Non-coders who want better AI-built products
* OSS maintainers who want cleaner AI-generated contributions

The strongest reputation angle is not the CLI itself.

The strongest reputation angle is the philosophy:

> AI builders need repo memory, not just prompts.
