# Recall OS Commands

This document records the Recall OS commands available to humans and AI agents.

## Completion Gate

Before claiming implementation work is complete, run:

```txt
pnpm test:run
pnpm typecheck
recall doctor
```

If `recall doctor` reports errors, fix them or report why they cannot be fixed. If it reports
warnings, address them or record why they are acceptable.

Package binary behavior is covered by binary integration tests.

## Commands

### `recall init`

Initialize neutral repository memory.

Options:

- `--preset <id>`: apply optional preset guidance and proposed decisions.
- `--dry-run`: show planned writes without writing files.
- `--force`: overwrite existing files explicitly.

### `recall preset list`

List built-in presets.

### `recall feature create <name>`

Create feature memory docs under the configured features directory.

Options:

- `--dry-run`: show planned writes without writing files.
- `--force`: overwrite existing files explicitly.

### `recall adr create <title>`

Create a proposed ADR under the configured ADR directory.

Options:

- `--dry-run`: show planned writes without writing files.
- `--force`: overwrite existing files explicitly.

### `recall module create <name>`

Create module memory docs under the configured modules directory.

Options:

- `--dry-run`: show planned writes without writing files.
- `--force`: overwrite existing files explicitly.

### `recall doctor`

Check whether repository memory is structurally healthy enough for AI-assisted work, whether basic
engineering evidence is present, and whether memory references decisions that exist and are accepted.

Doctor also runs deterministic drift checks: feature or module memory that references a missing ADR
is an error, and memory that references a not-yet-accepted ADR is a warning.

Exit codes:

- `0`: healthy
- `1`: warnings only
- `2`: errors
