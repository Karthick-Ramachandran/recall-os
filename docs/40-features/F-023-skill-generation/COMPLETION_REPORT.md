# Completion Report: Skill Generation

## Status

Complete.

## Tasks Completed

- T1: Planned the feature and accepted ADR-0004 (portable, scriptless skills).
- T2: Built the skill catalog and the SKILL.md renderer.
- T3: Built dual-target generation, `persist skill create`, and `persist skill list`.
- T4: Dogfooded by regenerating the repository's own skills, updated docs, and recorded evidence.

## Research

The Agent Skills format was confirmed against the official documentation
(code.claude.com/docs/skills and agentskills.io) before implementation: required `name`
(`^[a-z0-9](-?[a-z0-9])*$`, max 64, matches directory) and `description` (max 1024, "Use when"
trigger language), portability via standard fields only, and keeping bodies small.

## Files Changed

- `src/core/skills/skill-catalog.ts`, `render-skill.ts`, `generate-skill.ts` (new)
- `src/commands/skill/create.ts`, `src/commands/skill/list.ts` (new)
- `src/cli/main.ts`, `src/core/generator/generate-init.ts`
- `tests/unit/skills/*`, `tests/integration/skill-command.test.ts` (new)
- `docs/adrs/ADR-0004-skill-generation-portable-and-scriptless.md` (new)
- `docs/30-modules/skills/` (new module memory)
- `docs/40-features/F-023-skill-generation/` (new feature memory)
- `docs/ai/PERSIST_COMMANDS.md`, `README.md`
- `.claude/skills/*`, `.agents/skills/*` (regenerated from the tool — dogfood)
- `examples/generated-*/` (regenerated command reference)

## Tests Run

- `pnpm test:run`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm format:check`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm pack:check`
- `node dist/cli.js doctor`

## Results

- Full test suite passed: 46 files, 219 tests (10 new for skills).
- `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, and `pnpm format:check` passed.
- `pnpm build` passed; `pnpm pack:check` validated 169 files.
- `node dist/cli.js doctor` passed after this report was written.
- Dogfood: the repository's 10 skills were regenerated from the catalog, replacing hand-authored
  files. The generated descriptions now carry "Use when" trigger language.

## Remaining Risks

- The catalog is a fixed MVP set; richer or project-specific skills are future work.
- MCP context-capture skills (for example a Figma design-context skill) are deferred to a follow-up.

## Docs Updated

- ADR-0004, F-023 feature memory, skills module memory, command reference, and README.

## Engineering Standards

Engineering standards were followed. The change is scoped, tested, documented, and governed by an
accepted ADR. Generated skills are plain Markdown with no scripts, no Claude-only fields, and no
network, telemetry, or runtime agent behavior.
