# Review: Persist Adopt

## Status

Passed.

## Scope Review

- Adds an `adopt` concern (inspection + generation) and a thin `persist adopt` command.
- Reuses config loading and the safe write pipeline. No schema or other module behavior changed.

## Neutrality And Correctness Review

- Every output is proposed: the report status is Proposed and each framework ADR is Proposed.
- No accepted decision is produced, asserted in unit tests.
- Inference is conservative and limited to manifest and marker signals.

## Security Review

- Inspection is read-only and never executes repository code, makes network calls, or installs
  anything (ADR-0003).
- Writes are confined to the project root, symlink-protected, and non-destructive by default.

## Dogfooding Review

### Did the workflow catch any issue?

Writing the ADR first forced the "propose, never accept" boundary to be explicit before any code,
which kept the generator from ever emitting an accepted decision.

### What should Persist OS improve before public release?

Infer module boundaries and ownership as proposals, and broaden ecosystem detection, all under the
same proposed-only rule.
