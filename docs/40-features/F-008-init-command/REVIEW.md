# Review: Init Command

## Status

Passed.

## Findings

- No architecture drift found. P5 implements the documented repository-memory-first init behavior.
- No dependency drift found. Commander was added for the documented CLI parsing role.
- No module drift found. Command code orchestrates and core modules retain filesystem, config,
  generator, and preset ownership.
- No security drift found. Init writes route through one safe write plan and unknown presets write
  nothing.
- No testing drift found. Integration and golden tests cover P5 acceptance criteria.
- No documentation drift found. Feature docs and module memory were updated.

## Review Checklist

- Passed: Init stays architecture-neutral by default.
- Passed: Empty-folder init works.
- Passed: Git is not required.
- Passed: Preset output remains guidance or proposed decisions.
- Passed: Existing files are skipped by default.
- Passed: Dry run writes nothing.
- Passed: Force is explicit.
- Passed: Unknown presets write nothing.
- Passed: All writes use the safe write pipeline.
- Passed: No package `bin`, build, release, network, telemetry, MCP runtime, AI API, or app code
  scope was added.
- Passed: Tests cover acceptance criteria.
