# Completion Report: Init Command

## Status

Complete.

## Tasks Completed

- T0: Added P5 feature docs and CLI/module memory.
- T1: Added Commander dependency with pnpm.
- T2: Implemented init generation planning.
- T3: Implemented init command orchestration and testable CLI parser.
- T4: Added integration and golden tests.
- T5: Ran verification and completed review evidence.

## Files Changed

- Added `src/cli/main.ts`.
- Added `src/commands/init.ts`.
- Added `src/core/generator/generate-init.ts`.
- Added init integration and golden tests.
- Added P5 feature docs under `docs/40-features/F-008-init-command/`.
- Added CLI module memory under `docs/30-modules/cli/`.
- Updated repository-init, repository-memory, and generator module memory.
- Added Commander dependency and updated `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

## Tests Run

- `pnpm test:run tests/integration/init-command.test.ts tests/golden`
- `pnpm test:run`
- `pnpm typecheck`

## Results

- Focused P5 tests: passed, 5 test files and 12 tests.
- Full test suite: passed, 19 test files and 90 tests.
- `pnpm typecheck`: passed.

## Remaining Risks

- P5 does not add package `bin` or build/release wiring. Installed binary behavior remains P10
  scope.
- P5 uses concise in-code templates. Rich generated docs and template files remain future work.
- P5 does not implement technology detection or `preset list`.

## Docs Updated

- P5 feature docs.
- CLI module memory.
- Repository init module memory.
- Repository memory module memory.
- Generator module memory.

## Engineering Standards

Engineering standards were followed. The change is scoped, tested, documented, and includes
completion evidence. No network, telemetry, MCP runtime, cloud behavior, AI API behavior, remote
templates, or production application code was added.
