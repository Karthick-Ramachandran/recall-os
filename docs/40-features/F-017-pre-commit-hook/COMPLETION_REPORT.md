# Completion Report: Pre-Commit Hook Generation

## Status

Complete.

## Tasks Completed

- T1: Planned the feature and accepted ADR-0002 (tracked hook, neutral detection, no git mutation).
- T2: Added the `preCommitGates` config field and executable-file write support.
- T3: Implemented neutral gate detection and deterministic hook rendering.
- T4: Wired generation into `persist init` and printed the activation proposal.
- T5: Updated module memory, product docs, examples, review, and completion evidence.

## Files Changed

- `src/core/config/config-schema.ts`, `src/core/config/default-config.ts`
- `src/core/filesystem/write-plan.ts`, `src/core/filesystem/write-file-safe.ts`
- `src/core/hooks/detect-gates.ts` (new), `src/core/hooks/generate-hook.ts` (new)
- `src/commands/init.ts`
- `src/core/generator/generate-init.ts`
- `tests/unit/hooks/detect-gates.test.ts` (new), `tests/unit/hooks/generate-hook.test.ts` (new)
- `tests/unit/config/config-schema.test.ts`, `tests/unit/filesystem/write-file-safe.test.ts`
- `tests/integration/init-command.test.ts`, `tests/golden/generated-generic.test.ts`
- `docs/adrs/ADR-0002-pre-commit-hook-generation.md` (new)
- `docs/30-modules/hooks/` (new module memory)
- `docs/40-features/F-017-pre-commit-hook/` (new feature memory)
- `docs/00-product/ROADMAP.md`, `README.md`, `docs/ai/PERSIST_COMMANDS.md`
- `examples/generated-*/` (regenerated; hook added, command reference refreshed)

## Tests Run

- `pnpm test:run`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm format:check`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm pack:check`
- `node dist/cli.js doctor`

## Results

- Full test suite passed: 36 files, 187 tests (17 new tests added).
- `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, and `pnpm format:check` passed.
- `pnpm build` passed; `pnpm pack:check` validated 104 package files (up from 100 for four example
  hooks).
- `node dist/cli.js doctor` passed after this report was written.
- Manual verification: `persist init` writes an executable `.persist/hooks/pre-commit`; with a
  `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`, detection seeds `pnpm run test` and `pnpm run typecheck`.

## Incident And Recovery

- During example regeneration, an `init --force` was accidentally run in the repository root and
  overwrote curated memory files. Because all memory is committed, the change was detected
  immediately and fully restored with `git checkout`, and preset junk was removed. No curated
  content was lost. Verified the working tree contains only intended F-017 changes before commit.

## Remaining Risks

- Editing `preCommitGates` in config does not regenerate the hook; `persist init --force` is
  required. A `persist hooks sync` command and a Doctor hook-versus-config drift check are noted as
  future work.
- `persist init` does not yet warn when run in a non-empty repository root.

## Docs Updated

- ADR-0002, F-017 feature memory, hooks module memory, roadmap, README, and command reference.

## Engineering Standards

Engineering standards were followed. The change is scoped, tested, documented, and governed by an
accepted ADR. No network, telemetry, MCP runtime, AI API, cloud behavior, or generated production
app code was added. The one new capability (writing an executable file and proposing a git config
command) is recorded in ADR-0002 with security impact.
