# Completion Report: Empty-Folder Init And Repository Memory First

## Status

Complete.

## Tasks Completed

- T0: Added feature docs.
- T1: Added module memory.
- T2: Updated product and architecture docs.
- T3: Synchronized root product docs.
- T4: Ran verification and completed review evidence.

## Files Changed

- Added P1.7 feature docs under `docs/40-features/F-004-empty-folder-init-repository-memory-first/`.
- Added repository init module memory under `docs/30-modules/repository-init/`.
- Added repository memory module memory under `docs/30-modules/repository-memory/`.
- Updated canonical and root product docs.
- Updated memory engine, architecture, and opinion pack docs.

## Tests Run

- `pnpm test:run`
- `pnpm typecheck`

## Results

- `pnpm test:run`: passed, 8 test files and 32 tests.
- `pnpm typecheck`: passed.
- Manual docs review: passed.

## Remaining Risks

- P1.7 is documentation-only; future runtime `init`, technology detection, preset rendering, and `adopt` behavior still require implementation and tests.
- Git is documented as optional for init, but runtime behavior is not implemented yet.

## Docs Updated

- `recall init` is documented as valid in empty folders.
- Recall OS is documented as repository memory first, not application generation.
- Greenfield, existing repository, and legacy adoption workflows are documented.
- Presets and detected technologies remain guidance or proposed decisions unless accepted by humans.

## Engineering Standards

Engineering standards were followed. No runtime code, config, CLI, MCP, template, dependency, network, telemetry, or generated app behavior changed.
