# Completion Report: Preset System

## Status

Complete.

## Tasks Completed

- T0: Added P4 feature docs and preset module memory.
- T1: Implemented preset schema and validation.
- T2: Implemented built-in preset registry.
- T3: Added preset unit tests.
- T4: Ran verification and completed review evidence.

## Files Changed

- Added `src/core/presets/` schema, validation, and registry helpers.
- Added minimal built-in presets under `src/presets/`.
- Added preset unit tests under `tests/unit/presets/`.
- Added P4 feature docs under `docs/40-features/F-007-preset-system/`.
- Added preset module memory under `docs/30-modules/presets/`.
- Updated opinion-pack product and module memory docs.

## Tests Run

- `pnpm test:run tests/unit/presets`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm test:run`

## Results

- Focused preset tests: passed, 2 test files and 14 tests.
- `pnpm typecheck`: passed.
- Full test suite: passed, 14 test files and 78 tests.

## Remaining Risks

- P4 does not implement CLI preset commands. `preset list` comes later.
- P4 does not generate files from presets. Future init/generator work must route through safe write
  planning.
- Built-in preset content is intentionally minimal. Rich framework guidance is deferred until real
  usage proves the model.

## Docs Updated

- P4 feature docs.
- Preset module memory.
- Opinion-pack module memory.
- `docs/10-architecture/OPINION_PACKS.md`.
- `docs/00-product/BUILD_PRIORITY.md`.
- Root `priority.md`.

## Engineering Standards

Engineering standards were followed. The change is scoped, tested, documented, and includes
completion evidence. No dependency, network, telemetry, MCP runtime, cloud behavior, file write
behavior, CLI behavior, or generated production app code was added.
