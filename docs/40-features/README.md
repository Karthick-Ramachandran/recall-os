# Feature Memory

Feature memory records requirements, acceptance criteria, plans, tests, reviews, and completion
evidence.

Module work also starts here. A request like `Build the preset module` should create a feature
folder such as `F-###-preset-module/` before any implementation task begins.

Future feature folders should use:

```txt
docs/40-features/F-###-<feature>/
  PRD.md
  ACCEPTANCE.md
  ARCHITECTURE_IMPACT.md
  CHANGE_REQUESTS.md
  PLAN.md
  TASKS.md
  TEST_PLAN.md
  REVIEW.md
  COMPLETION_REPORT.md
```

Agents should not implement meaningful feature work without a feature plan or clear source-of-truth
reference.

For module work, the feature folder should define the module brief, use cases, acceptance criteria,
architecture impact, test plan, and task breakdown. Module memory under `docs/30-modules/` records
what future agents need to remember after or during implementation.
