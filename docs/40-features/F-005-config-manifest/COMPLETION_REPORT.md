# Completion Report: Config Manifest

## Status

Complete.

## Tasks Completed

- T0: Added P2 docs and module memory.
- T1: Added Zod dependency.
- T2: Implemented config schema, defaults, load, and write helpers.
- T3: Added config tests and root `.persist/config.json`.
- T4: Ran verification and completed review evidence.

## Files Changed

- Added `src/core/config/` schema, defaults, load, and write helpers.
- Added `tests/unit/config/` coverage.
- Added root `.persist/config.json`.
- Added P2 feature docs under `docs/40-features/F-005-config-manifest/`.
- Added config module memory under `docs/30-modules/config/`.
- Updated canonical and root product/build-priority docs for the simplified P2 config shape.
- Added Zod dependency and updated `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

## Tests Run

- `pnpm test:run`
- `pnpm typecheck`

## Results

- `pnpm test:run`: passed, 11 test files and 50 tests.
- `pnpm typecheck`: passed.
- Manual docs and security review: passed.

## Remaining Risks

- P2 does not implement CLI commands. Future commands still need to call `loadConfig` and
  `writeConfig`.
- P2 intentionally does not index accepted decisions, proposed decisions, or organization standards.
- P2 supports only `skip-existing` and `overwrite` write policies; backup and fail-on-conflict
  remain future.

## Docs Updated

- P2 feature docs and config module memory were added.
- Product config example was simplified to remove decision indexes and organization standards.
- Build priority now states P2 config does not include decision indexes or organization standards.

## Engineering Standards

Engineering standards were followed. Completion evidence is recorded, tests were run, and no runtime
scope beyond config helpers was added.
