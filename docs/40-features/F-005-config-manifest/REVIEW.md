# Review: Config Manifest

## Drift Review

Status: Complete.

Review areas:

- Config module matches module boundaries.
- Zod dependency matches accepted tech stack.
- Config excludes decision indexes and organization standards in P2.
- Config writes use safe write policy.
- No CLI, template, preset, doctor, MCP, network, telemetry, or AI API scope was added.

## Findings

- No architecture drift found. `core/config` matches the documented module boundary and depends only on filesystem safety, Node built-ins, and Zod validation.
- No dependency drift found. Zod is already listed in the accepted MVP tech stack for validation.
- No scope drift found. P2 did not add CLI commands, template rendering, preset runtime, doctor checks, network, telemetry, MCP runtime, or AI API behavior.
- No decision-memory drift found. P2 config intentionally excludes decision indexes and organization standards.
- No security drift found. Config schema is strict, unknown keys are rejected, unsafe paths are rejected, and config writes use the existing safe write pipeline.

## Manual Review Evidence

- Root `.recall/config.json` validates through the config schema test.
- Root config contains no decisions, organization standards, secrets, or secret-like custom fields.
- `pnpm test:run` passed.
- `pnpm typecheck` passed.
- Root product docs are synchronized with canonical product docs.
