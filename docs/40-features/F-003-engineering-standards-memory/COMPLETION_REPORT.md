# Completion Report: Engineering Standards Memory

## Status

Complete.

## Tasks Completed

- T0: Added engineering standards docs.
- T1: Added feature docs and module memory.
- T2: Updated product docs, memory model docs, and project structure docs.
- T3: Updated root agent routing, review docs, drift docs, and relevant skills.
- T4: Ran verification and completed review evidence.

## Files Changed

- Added `docs/60-engineering/ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md`.
- Added `docs/60-engineering/AI_AGENT_RULES.md`.
- Added `docs/60-engineering/CODE_REVIEW_RULES.md`.
- Added feature docs under `docs/40-features/F-003-engineering-standards-memory/`.
- Added module memory under `docs/30-modules/engineering-standards/` and
  `docs/30-modules/agent-rules/`.
- Updated product docs, memory engine docs, project structure docs, root agent files, AI strategy
  docs, quality review docs, and skill templates.

## Tests Run

- `pnpm test:run`
- `pnpm typecheck`

## Results

- `pnpm test:run`: passed, 8 test files and 32 tests.
- `pnpm typecheck`: passed.
- Manual docs review: passed.

## Remaining Risks

- P1.6 is documentation-only; there is no runtime enforcement yet.
- Additional split-out standards docs are intentionally deferred until the standards document grows
  or ownership requires it.

## Docs Updated

- Canonical and root product docs are synchronized.
- Root agent files route to engineering standards.
- Drift and review docs include engineering standards violations.
- Relevant Claude and portable agent skills route to engineering standards.

## Engineering Standards

Engineering standards were followed. No runtime code, config, CLI, MCP, template, dependency, or
generated app behavior changed.
