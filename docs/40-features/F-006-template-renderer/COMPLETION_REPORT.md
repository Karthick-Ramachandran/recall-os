# Completion Report: Template Renderer

## Status

Complete.

## Tasks Completed

- T0: Added P3 feature docs and generator module memory.
- T1: Added ADR-0001 for deterministic placeholder rendering.
- T2: Implemented template context validation.
- T3: Implemented template rendering.
- T4: Added renderer unit tests.
- T5: Updated docs and completed review evidence.

## Files Changed

- Added `src/core/generator/template-context.ts`.
- Added `src/core/generator/render-template.ts`.
- Added `tests/unit/generator/render-template.test.ts`.
- Added P3 feature docs under `docs/40-features/F-006-template-renderer/`.
- Added generator module memory under `docs/30-modules/generator/`.
- Added `docs/adrs/ADR-0001-deterministic-placeholder-renderer.md`.
- Updated product and architecture docs that referenced Eta.

## Tests Run

- `pnpm test:run tests/unit/generator/render-template.test.ts`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm test:run`

## Results

- Focused renderer tests: passed, 1 test file and 14 tests.
- `pnpm typecheck`: passed.
- Full test suite: passed, 12 test files and 64 tests.

## Remaining Risks

- P3 does not load template files or write generated files. Future generator flows must connect
  rendered strings to safe write planning.
- P3 does not support conditionals, loops, helpers, partials, or includes. Richer template behavior
  requires a future ADR.
- P3 does not define markdown escaping policy. Generated document escaping can be addressed when
  concrete templates exist.

## Docs Updated

- P3 feature docs.
- Generator module memory.
- ADR-0001.
- `docs/10-architecture/TECH_STACK.md`.
- `docs/10-architecture/MEMORY_ENGINE.md`.
- `docs/00-product/PRD.md`.
- `docs/00-product/BUILD_PRIORITY.md`.
- Root `PRD.md`.
- Root `priority.md`.

## Engineering Standards

Engineering standards were followed. The change is scoped, tested, documented, and includes
completion evidence. No network, telemetry, MCP runtime, cloud behavior, file write behavior, or new
dependency was added.
