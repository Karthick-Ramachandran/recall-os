# Review: Strategic Reframe

## Drift Review

Status: Complete.

Review areas:

- Architecture-neutral principle appears in product docs.
- Preset/opinion-pack distinction is clear.
- Drift definition matches accepted repository memory.
- P1.5 does not alter runtime behavior.

## Findings

- No runtime behavior changed.
- Core docs now state Persist OS is architecture-neutral.
- `persist init` is documented as neutral by default.
- `preset` remains the CLI term and is defined architecturally as an opinion pack.
- Preset-generated architecture choices are documented as proposed or optional, not silently
  accepted.
- Drift is now documented as mismatch with accepted repository memory, not mismatch with Persist OS
  recommendations.
- Root `PRD.md`, `BRD.md`, and `priority.md` match canonical product docs under `docs/00-product/`.
- Existing tests and typecheck pass.
