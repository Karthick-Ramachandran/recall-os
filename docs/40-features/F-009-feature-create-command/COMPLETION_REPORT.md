# Completion Report: Feature Create Command

## Status

Complete.

## Tasks Completed

- T0: Added P6 dogfooding docs and feature-workflow module memory.
- T1: Implemented feature numbering and same-slug folder reuse.
- T2: Implemented deterministic feature document generation.
- T3: Implemented `feature create <name>` command orchestration and CLI wiring.
- T4: Added unit and integration tests.
- T5: Ran verification and completed review evidence.

## Files Changed

- `src/core/naming/feature-number.ts`
- `src/core/generator/generate-feature.ts`
- `src/commands/feature/create.ts`
- `src/cli/main.ts`
- `tests/unit/naming/feature-number.test.ts`
- `tests/unit/generator/generate-feature.test.ts`
- `tests/integration/feature-create-command.test.ts`
- `tests/helpers/init-test-helpers.ts`
- `docs/40-features/F-009-feature-create-command/`
- `docs/30-modules/feature-workflow/`
- related module memory and priority docs

## Tests Run

- `pnpm test:run tests/unit/naming/feature-number.test.ts tests/unit/generator/generate-feature.test.ts tests/integration/feature-create-command.test.ts`
- `pnpm test:run`
- `pnpm typecheck`

## Results

- Focused P6 tests passed: 3 files, 17 tests.
- Full test suite passed: 22 files, 107 tests.
- Typecheck passed.

## Remaining Risks

- Package `bin` and release wiring remain deferred to P10, so command coverage is through
  `main(argv, io)`.
- Feature docs are concise starter memory; humans or agents still need to fill in PRD, acceptance,
  architecture impact, test plan, tasks, review, and completion substance.
- Doctor drift detection is still future work.

## Docs Updated

- P6 feature docs.
- Feature-workflow module memory.
- CLI, generator, and naming module memory.
- Module boundary and priority docs.

## Engineering Standards

- No network, telemetry, MCP runtime, app code generation, or package release behavior was added.
- All writes route through the existing safe write plan and safe write execution pipeline.
- Repository memory was updated before completion was claimed.
