# Review: Feature Create Command

## Status

Passed.

## Review Checklist

- Feature docs exist before implementation.
- Command code orchestrates only.
- Core naming owns feature number rules.
- Core generator returns write inputs only.
- Filesystem owns writes.
- Missing config fails clearly.
- Unsafe names are rejected.
- Dry run writes nothing.
- Force is explicit.
- Existing files skip by default.
- Tests cover acceptance criteria.
- Module memory is updated.

## Findings

- No architecture drift found. Command code orchestrates while naming, generator, and filesystem
  modules own their respective rules.
- No security drift found. Feature names pass through `slugify`, generated destinations pass through
  safe write planning, and execution refuses write plans with errors.
- Idempotent same-slug behavior was made explicit because skip/force semantics require reruns to
  target existing feature memory instead of allocating duplicate folders.

## Verification

- `pnpm test:run` passed: 22 files, 107 tests.
- `pnpm typecheck` passed.
