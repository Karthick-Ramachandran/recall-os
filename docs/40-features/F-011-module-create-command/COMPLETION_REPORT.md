# Completion Report: Module Create Command

## Status

Complete.

## Tasks Completed

- T0: Added P8 dogfooding docs and module-workflow module memory.
- T1: Extracted shared write-summary formatting.
- T2: Implemented deterministic module memory generation.
- T3: Implemented `module create <name>` command orchestration and CLI wiring.
- T4: Added unit and integration tests.
- T5: Ran verification and completed review evidence.

## Files Changed

- `src/commands/write-summary.ts`
- `src/core/generator/generate-module.ts`
- `src/commands/module/create.ts`
- `src/cli/main.ts`
- `src/commands/init.ts`
- `src/commands/feature/create.ts`
- `src/commands/adr/create.ts`
- `tests/unit/generator/generate-module.test.ts`
- `tests/integration/module-create-command.test.ts`
- `docs/40-features/F-011-module-create-command/`
- `docs/30-modules/module-workflow/`
- related module memory and priority docs

## Tests Run

- `pnpm test:run tests/unit/generator/generate-module.test.ts tests/integration/module-create-command.test.ts tests/integration/init-command.test.ts tests/integration/feature-create-command.test.ts tests/integration/adr-create-command.test.ts`
- `pnpm test:run`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `git diff --check`

## Results

- Focused P8 and command-output regression tests passed: 5 files, 34 tests.
- Full test suite passed: 27 files, 134 tests.
- Typecheck passed.
- Diff check passed.

## Remaining Risks

- Package `bin` and release wiring remain deferred to P10, so command coverage is through
  `main(argv, io)`.
- Module docs are concise starter memory; humans or agents still need to fill in ownership,
  boundaries, interfaces, tests, and decisions.
- Doctor drift detection is still future work.

## Docs Updated

- P8 feature docs.
- Module-workflow module memory.
- CLI, generator, and naming module memory.
- Priority docs.

## Engineering Standards

- No dependency, network, telemetry, MCP runtime, app code generation, package release behavior, or
  AI behavior was added.
- All writes route through the existing safe write plan and safe write execution pipeline.
- Repository memory was updated before completion was claimed.
