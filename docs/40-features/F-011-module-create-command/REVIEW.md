# Review: Module Create Command

## Status

Passed.

## Review Checklist

- Feature docs exist before implementation.
- Command code orchestrates only.
- Core generator returns write inputs only.
- Filesystem owns writes.
- Missing config fails clearly.
- Unsafe names are rejected.
- Dry run writes nothing.
- Force is explicit.
- Existing files skip by default.
- Module create does not create feature delivery docs.
- Shared write-summary helper preserves existing command output.
- Tests cover acceptance criteria.
- Module memory is updated.

## Findings

- No architecture drift found. Command code orchestrates while generator and filesystem modules own
  their respective rules.
- No security drift found. Module names pass through `slugify`, generated destinations pass through
  safe write planning, and execution refuses write plans with errors.
- Shared write-summary formatting was extracted without changing command behavior, as covered by
  existing init, feature, and ADR command tests.

## Verification

- `pnpm test:run` passed: 27 files, 134 tests.
- `pnpm typecheck` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed.
