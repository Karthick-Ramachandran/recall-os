# Review: Core Filesystem Safety

## Drift Review

Status: Complete.

Review areas:

- File write policy still matches `docs/10-architecture/FILE_WRITE_POLICY.md`.
- Secure write behavior still matches `docs/20-security/SECURE_FILE_WRITES.md`.
- P1 does not add CLI commands, config, presets, templates, network calls, telemetry, or MCP
  runtime.
- Tests cover the required P1 security cases.

## Findings

- No architecture drift found.
- P1 stayed within `core/filesystem` and `core/naming`.
- No CLI commands, config manifest, presets, templates, network calls, telemetry, generated app
  code, or runtime MCP were added.
- File write behavior remains aligned with `docs/10-architecture/FILE_WRITE_POLICY.md`.
- Symlink refusal is implemented with best-effort `lstat` checks and does not claim race-free TOCTOU
  protection.
- Atomic temp-file rename writes and case-insensitive collision handling remain deferred as
  documented module decisions.
