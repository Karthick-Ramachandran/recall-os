# PRD: Doctor Command

## Purpose

Implement `persist doctor` so Persist OS can validate whether repository memory is healthy enough
for AI-assisted work.

P9 turns Persist OS from only creating memory into also protecting memory.

## Problem

Persist OS can create repository, feature, ADR, and module memory, but it cannot yet verify whether
that memory remains structurally healthy.

Without Doctor, AI agents and humans can claim completion while required repository memory is
missing, invalid, or incomplete.

## Decision

P9 adds a read-only Doctor command.

Doctor validates config, required files, required docs, and generated memory structure.

P9 also adds generated command-reference memory so agents can discover how to use Persist OS from
repository docs.

## In Scope

- `persist doctor` command.
- Doctor severity model: `error`, `warning`, `info`.
- Exit codes: `0` healthy, `1` warnings only, `2` errors.
- Config existence, JSON parsing, and schema validation checks.
- Required root, AI, product, architecture, security, quality, engineering, and ADR index docs.
- Required configured directories.
- Feature folder required docs.
- Module folder required docs.
- ADR required sections.
- Generated `docs/ai/PERSIST_COMMANDS.md`.
- Agent instruction updates that describe Doctor as an AI completion gate.
- Unit and integration tests.

## Non-Goals

- Accepted ADR drift detection.
- Code-to-module ownership drift.
- Dependency drift.
- Stale completion content detection.
- JSON reporter.
- Auto-fix behavior.
- Package `bin` or release wiring.
- Network, telemetry, MCP runtime, AI API, cloud behavior, or production app code.

## Success Criteria

- Healthy initialized repositories pass Doctor.
- Missing config fails Doctor.
- Invalid config fails Doctor.
- Missing root, AI, baseline docs, configured dirs, feature docs, module docs, or ADR sections fail
  Doctor.
- Doctor output is grouped by severity and actionable.
- Doctor returns `0`, `1`, or `2` based on findings.
- Init generates local command-reference memory.
- Root agent files document Doctor as a completion gate.
